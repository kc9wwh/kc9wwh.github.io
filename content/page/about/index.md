Welcome to my blog!

As a seasoned Customer Success Manager with over 8 years of experience in enterprise solutions and SaaS, I am driven by a passion for helping clients achieve exceptional outcomes. My journey in the tech industry has been anything but conventional, and that’s what makes it so exciting. With a career spanning diverse roles and industries, I’ve cultivated a unique perspective that allows me to bridge the gap between technology and human connection.

At Jamf, I had the privilege of leading a talented team responsible for managing a $50M book of business. Through strategic planning and a relentless focus on customer-centric initiatives, we achieved a 20% customer growth rate, a remarkable 97% retention rate, and increased revenue by 25% through advanced adoption strategies. More recently, at Files.com, I focused on simplifying complex solutions to drive efficiency for clients, enhancing their workflows by an impressive 300% through process automation.

Before diving into Customer Success, I honed my technical expertise in a variety of roles. As a Systems Administrator at Lands' End, I tackled enterprise-level IT challenges. At U.S. Cellular, I served as a Network Field Engineer, ensuring reliable connectivity across a wide range of environments. My tech journey began even earlier when I worked as a Network Technician for the Black River Falls School District—a role I took on while still in high school, laying the foundation for my career in technology.

But my story doesn’t end there. Outside the professional realm, I’ve always been drawn to community service and hands-on problem-solving. As a licensed Ham Radio operator, I’ve combined my technical skills with my love for communication, contributing to emergency preparedness initiatives. My time as a volunteer Firefighter, EMT, Hazmat Technician, and Rescue Technician taught me the value of teamwork, quick decision-making, and staying calm under pressure—skills that continue to influence my approach to leadership and customer success.

Through every chapter of my career and life, one thing has remained constant: my enthusiasm for learning, connecting, and making a meaningful impact. Whether it’s optimizing SaaS adoption strategies, mentoring teams, or diving into the latest tech trends, I’m passionate about building solutions that empower people and businesses to thrive.

Thanks for stopping by—I’m thrilled to have you here. Let’s connect, collaborate, and share ideas to drive success together!
